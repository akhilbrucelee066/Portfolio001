            A dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a interesting point of
            view in Development and Design, seeking opportunities to apply
            skills in trending computer science technologies and contribute to

          <h2>my career</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Computer Science student with a strong passion for coding and
            intrest in exploring trending technologies in Computer Science. In process of development i've explored technologies like React Native, Gemini AI, Firebase, Firestore, API, etc. and build an AI Comprehensive Product Review app called "Ultimate Gadget Guide". With
            curiosity in learing Artificial Intelligence, i also got into
            learning machine learing and data domain. now i am in bud stage of
            exploring but surely will take part in much bigger risks and achievements.
          </p>
          <h2>my alter career</h2>
          <p>
I am a computer science student with a creative spark that fuels my passion for art and design. Alongside my journey in technology, I’ve nurtured an alternate path as an aspiring artist and designer.
Sketching and painting have always been my escape into a world of expression. From detailed pencil sketches to vibrant paintings, I strive to capture the beauty of moments and emotions through my work. Over time, I expanded my canvas into the digital realm, honing skills in graphic design and mastering tools that blend creativity with technology.
Brushing up my design expertise has been both a challenge and a joy I’ve worked on projects that combine artistry with purpose, and I continuously seek opportunities to grow and learn. Art has taught me discipline, patience, and how to look at problems from a fresh perspective—skills that translate beautifully into all areas of life.
Through my creative journey, I hope to inspire, connect, and leave a mark, whether it’s through a single brushstroke or an innovative design solution.
